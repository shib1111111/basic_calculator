# Basic Calculator Web Application

This repository contains a concise yet comprehensive calculator web application developed using the Streamlit framework in Python. The application allows users to input two numbers and choose from a selection of arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The application then executes the selected operation and displays the resulting output.

## Project Structure

The project is well-organized and includes the following files:

- **app.py**: This serves as the main file that defines the Streamlit web application and manages user input and output.
- **calculator_logic.py**: This module contains the fundamental logic of the calculator, including the calculation functions.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the required Python dependencies for running the application.
