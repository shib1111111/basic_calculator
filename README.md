# basic_calculator
This is a small realistic calculator web app built using the Streamlit framework in Python. It allows users to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform on those numbers. The app then displays the result of the calculation.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
**app.py**: The main file that defines the Streamlit web app and handles user input/output.
**calculator_logic.py**: A module that defines the core logic of the calculator (i.e., the calculation functions).
**requirements.txt**: A file that specifies the Python dependencies required to run the app.
