# basic_calculator
This is a concise yet comprehensive calculator web application developed using the Streamlit framework in Python. Users can input two numbers and choose from a selection of arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The application then executes the operation and displays the resulting output.

### The project is well-organized and includes the following files:

**app.py**: This serves as the main file that defines the Streamlit web application and manages user input and output.
**calculator_logic.py**: This module contains the fundamental logic of the calculator, such as the calculation functions.
**requirements.txt**: This file lists the required Python dependencies for running the applicatio
